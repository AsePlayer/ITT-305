## Which part of C.I.A. makes ACID a valid security topic?

Several aspects of ACID overlap with those of C.I.A., and they may even be considered synonymous at times. In particular, the Integrity component of the C.I.A. is particularly relevant to ACID given that consistency is defined similarly. 

For example: developing and maintaining integrity requires credibility, consistency, truthfulness, accuracy, timeliness, and assurance. In the absence of atomicity and consistency, achieving this objective is difficult.

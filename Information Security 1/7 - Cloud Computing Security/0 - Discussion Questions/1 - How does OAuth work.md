## Explain how OAuth works and how it relates to computer security.

The OAuth protocol does not share password information; instead, authorization tokens are used to verify consumer and service provider identities. As the name implies, OAuth is an authentication protocol that allows you to authorize one application to interact with another on your behalf without providing your password to the other application. This is an excellent tool for computer security, as we can obfuscate the process with tokens instead of using sensitive data.

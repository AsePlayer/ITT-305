After this assignment, you will be able to transition a PHP application from the localhost to an online hosting service.

1. First, view “How to – Deploy a PHP Application on Azure,” located in the topic Resources.
2. Move the Jokes app and database to an Azure server.
3. Pay close attention to the files that contain server names such as php or the redirect URLs in the Google Sign On pages. These server URL names will change from localhost to the server name at Azure after copying the code to the online server.
4. Once you have chosen a service, create a ZIP file of the source code of the project and a database export SQL file.
5. Next, record a Loom video that shows the application being run from an online service and changes to the PHP code that you implemented. Explain why the changes were made.

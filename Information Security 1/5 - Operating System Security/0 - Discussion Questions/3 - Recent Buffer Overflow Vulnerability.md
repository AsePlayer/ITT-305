# Topic 5 DQ 3
## Review the news for data breaches in the past 12 months. Find an example of a successful attack that was accomplished through a buffer overflow. Explain the consequences that the company suffered from the attack.

**Problem:**
As an arbitrary 4-byte stack buffer overflow, CVE-2022-3602 was originally found to be CRITICAL by the OpenSSL project, and such vulnerabilities may allow remote code execution (RCE).

**Consequences:**
The vulnerability was patched after some serious testing. As a result of the early discovery of this vulnerability, they are not aware of any working exploits that could lead to remote code execution. In addition, they have not found any evidence that these vulnerabilities are being exploited at this time. Unfortunately, OpenSSL doesn't track deployments, so we don't have any statistics.

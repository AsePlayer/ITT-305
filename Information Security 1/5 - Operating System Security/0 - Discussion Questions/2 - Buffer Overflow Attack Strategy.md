## Describe the strategy used to make a buffer overflow attack work.

Buffer overflow attacks compromise applications by overwriting memory. This changes the execution path causing files to be damaged or private data to be exposed.

It is more common to encounter stack-based buffer overflows, which use stack memory only available during function execution.

A heap-based attack involves flooding a program's memory beyond the memory allocated for it at the current moment of runtime, which is much more difficult to accomplish.

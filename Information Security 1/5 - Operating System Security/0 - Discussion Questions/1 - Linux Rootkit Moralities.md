# Topic 5 DQ 1
## After reading “Linux Rootkit,” located in the topic Resources, what features of this application qualify it is a rootkit? The author says that “this toolkit is for fun, not evil.”  Explain your thoughts on this statement.

There are numerous functions that the rootkit can perform such as granting root privileges to a userland process, hiding or unhiding itself, protecting from being unloaded by the user, and disabling the unload protection as well.

Essentially, a Linux rootkit is a gigantic sandbox. I agree with the statement that it is "a tool for fun, not evil." The author provides some starter information, along with some links to further information. This article is one of many online articles that provide full source code for Linux rootkits, not to mention countless GitHub repositories, so it is difficult to fault its author for this particular publication.

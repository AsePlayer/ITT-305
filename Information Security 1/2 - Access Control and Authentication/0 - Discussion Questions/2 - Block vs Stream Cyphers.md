## Explain the differences between block and stream cyphers.

There are two types of symmetric key cyphers: *block cyphers* and *stream cyphers*. Block cyphers convert plaintext one block at a time, while stream cyphers convert one byte at a time. Block cyphers are slower than stream cyphers. Block cyphers make it hard to reverse encrypted text, whereas stream cyphers simplify the process.

## Explain the differences between hashing and encryption.

The process of hashing is to take data and map it to a specific numerical value by using an algorithm. The resulting code is then used to index items in a database.

Through the use of algorithms, encryption converts readable data into an unreadable format. The purpose of encryption is to prevent unauthorized access to information.


It is possible to decrypt encrypted data, but not hashed data.

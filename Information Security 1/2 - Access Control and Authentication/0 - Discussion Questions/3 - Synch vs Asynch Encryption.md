## Explain the differences between synchronous and asynchronous encryption.

**Asymmetric encryption** uses a pair of public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt messages when communicating, whereas **symmetric encryption** uses one key that must be shared among the recipients of the message.

While symmetric encryption is an old technique, asymmetric encryption is relatively new. As compared to symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption is an overall more time-intensive technique.

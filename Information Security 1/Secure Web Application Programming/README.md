# Secure Web Application Programming

After this assignment, you will know how to create a functioning web and database application, and be able to demonstrate and fix the vulnerabilities of poor coding practices in web and database applications. Include the following:

* Ability to enter jokes and search for jokes
* Ability to log in to the application
* SQL injection demonstration showing the user’s login data
* POST method used for login data
* Password complexity requirements
* Code explanation of the prepared statements
* Use of hashed passwords
----

## Part 1 - Jokes App

Follow a tutorial to setup a web and database server, write HTML and PHP pages to store a list of jokes and their answers.  Search the database for your favorite jokes.

Video #1 - Create a loom video screencast to demonstrate the function of the app.

## Part 2 – User’s Table

Extend the Jokes application to add a second table to the database, join the two tables with a foreign key, create a registration and login page, authenticate new users, and associate each joke with a user.

Video #2- Complete a loom video to demonstrate the new functions of the app.

## Part 3 – Security Upgrades

Conduct hacking tests to demonstrate that the application is vulnerable to SQL injection, weak passwords, cross-site scripting, and other problems. 

Video #3 - Complete a loom video to demonstrate the vulnerabilities of the app as shown in the tutorial.

Fix each of these problems with best-practice coding techniques.

Video #4 - Complete a loom video to demonstrate that the vulnerabilities have been resolved.

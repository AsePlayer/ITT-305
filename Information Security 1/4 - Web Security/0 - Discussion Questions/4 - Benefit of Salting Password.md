## Explain the benefit of password “salt” in a secure application.

Salts create unique passwords even when two users choose the same password. Salts are made up of random bits that are added to passwords before they are hashed. By salting passwords, you prevent hackers from reverse-engineering passwords and stealing them from databases. The salting process protects enterprise environments from hackers and prevents password theft.

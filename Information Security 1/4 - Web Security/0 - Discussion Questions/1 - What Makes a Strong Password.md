**Tips for creating strong passwords**

It is very imperative that you have a strong password that is easy to remember while simultaneously challenging to guess.


**A strong password** is one that includes a combination of numbers, symbols, uppercase, and lowercase letters. It is also very important to remember that you shouldn't use your name, birthday, username, or email address as your password.


Having a different password for each account can also ensure that even if one account is compromised, the rest will still be safe!

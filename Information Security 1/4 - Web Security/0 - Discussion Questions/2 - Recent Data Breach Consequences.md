# Topic 4 DQ 2
## SQL injection was a major topic in this assignment. Search the news for data breaches in the past 12 months that were a result of a SQL injection attack. Provide details about one of the companies attacked and the resulting consequences.

A post-auth SQL injection vulnerability was discovered by Sophos during internal security testing of **Sophos UTM**. The vulnerability was remedied by preventing the execution of code by an authenticated user in an update. The fix is included in **Sophos UTM v9.710 MR10**, which was released on March 9, 2022.


**UTM** devices offer a range of security functions in one appliance, including firewalls, intrusion prevention, gateway antiviruses, web proxy technologies, and more. While such devices are marketed as being easy to manage, they do have the disadvantage of creating a single point of failure.


It's extremely difficult to maintain trust when a device like this malfunctions to this extent even once. Consumer sentiment can determine whether the financial damages are irreparable. It is hoped that the damage will be minor since the problem was found during internal security testing. However, it all depends on whether the consumer updates to receive the latest security patch!

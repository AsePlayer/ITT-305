## After reading “Can I Be Arrested for Installing Keylogging Software,” located in the topic Resources, what laws apply to keyloggers and what are their penalties?

It is a serious crime to secretly install a keylogger on another person's, a business', or a public entity's computer (such as a library). Even your own computer may be subject to legal action if you install it: you are likely in violation of federal law if you allow anyone else to use your computer without disabling the keylogger.

Under federal law, keylogging is classified as wiretapping, and can result in incarceration for up to two decades!

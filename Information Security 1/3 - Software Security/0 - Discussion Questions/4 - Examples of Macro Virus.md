## In the Macro Virus activity, we created and demonstrated a Microsoft Word or Excel document with an embedded macro that can potentially do damaging activities to the other files in the same directory. What example(s) are there of macro viruses actually causing significant damage to a large number of people? What was the virus programmed to do?

**Macro Viruses** infect software rather than systems. They add their code to macros in documents, spreadsheets, and other data files. As the first macro virus to appear in 1995, the *"Concept" virus was mistakenly included in Microsoft's Compatibility Test CD-ROM, which was distribut*ed to hundreds of companies!

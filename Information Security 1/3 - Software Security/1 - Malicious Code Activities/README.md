After this assignment, you will be able to demonstrate the concepts used in malicious code behavior by creating applications that can identify malicious code and remove the threat.

For this assignment, create working versions of three malicious applications. Follow the tutorial, “Create a Keylogger in C# Part 1,” located in the topic Resources, as a basis for your program.

**Part 1: Key Logger Application**

Create a ZIP file containing source code of the application and a Loom video that addresses the following:

* Demonstrate the application in action and how it logs all keystrokes to a file.
* Explain how the app works, and how a target could be victimized by this application.

**Part 2: Python Virus**

Create a Python application that inserts itself into other .py files in the same directory, with a ZIP file containing source code of the application and a Loom video that addresses the following:

* Demonstrate the app in action. Show the infection, cleaning, and CRC check in action.
* Explain how this app is limited in its scope and capacity to do damage in comparison to real-world viruses.
* Explain how this code is similar to any of the real-world examples of viruses we have studied.
When creating the self-replicating program include the following:

1. Python Virus
Create a program that affects only the text files in the immediate shared directory. Do not call a directory scan or recursive effect to spread outside of the program’s folder.

1. Virus Signatures
Create a program that will scan the current directory and examine each python file. If the virus signature is located, clean the file of the infection.

1. CRC check
Create a program that will do an initial scan of the current directory, keeping record of the file size and date of each item in the folder. A secondary scan will be able to tell if the file statistics have changed.

**Part 3: Excel Macro Virus**

Create and demonstrate a Microsoft Word or Excel document with an embedded macro that can potentially do damaging activities to the other files in the same directory. Include a ZIP file containing source code of the application and a Loom video. Demonstrate the power of the VB code by pranking the user with the following features:

* Opening a second application and writing text to it.
* Displaying an unexpected web page.
* Deleting or renaming files in the same directory as the spreadsheet.
Experiment with other capabilities of VB for Office by exploring the Macro capabilities in the links below. The Loom video should address the following:

* Demonstrate the app in action. Show how the user must accept the macro operations. Demonstrate what prank or damage the script can do.
* Explain how this code is similar to any of the real-world examples of viruses we have studied.

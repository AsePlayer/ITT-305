## Search for the “OWASP Top 10” and explain how it relates to this course. Provide examples.

OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.

According to owasp.org, Companies should adopt this document and start the process of ensuring that their web applications minimize these risks. Using the OWASP Top 10 is perhaps the most effective first step towards changing the software development culture within your organization into one that produces more secure code.



Since this is an Information Security class, there is a lot we can learn from OWASP, especially the fundamentals! I have not personally had much experience making "secure" code, so there is a lot to learn! Especially when new threats spring up!



The new looming threats that weren't necessarily around in 2017 include: Insecure Design, Software and Data Integrity Failures, and Server-Side Request Forgery.

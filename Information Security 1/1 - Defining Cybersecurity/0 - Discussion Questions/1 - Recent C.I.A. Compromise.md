CAM4 Data Breach

Adult video streaming website CAM4 has had its Elasticsearch server breached exposing over 10 billion records.

The breached records included the following sensitive information:

* Full names
* Email addresses
* Sexual orientation 
* Chat transcripts
* Email correspondence transcripts
* Password hashes
* IP addresses
* Payment logs


It is interesting that data breaches come in all shapes and sizes, even if it is on some adult cam site like CAM4.

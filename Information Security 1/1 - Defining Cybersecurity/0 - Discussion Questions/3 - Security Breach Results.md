## In the course activities, three cases were reviewed: Yahoo, Equifax and Target. Research how these companies have succeeded (or failed) since their data breach. Explain how you see the breach affected their success.

**Yahoo** *(Legal Penalties)*: Charged with $35 million by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a penalty for falsely presenting the facts and failing to notify the customers' about the breach. A string of poor business choices has ultimately led to the company's demise. Eventually, Verizon agreed to purchase Yahoo's core business for $4.83 billion, around half of what they were asking for.


**Equifax** *(Poisoned Search Results, Unexpected Expenses, & Legal Penalties)*: Equifax took 1 month to alert everyone that they had been breached. They received various criticisms, including allegations of insider trading days after the breach, not immediately disclosing all information, accidentally setting up and linking to a phishing site on more than one occasion, and more. Nothing has since been done with the data itself, but Equifax's reputation is permanently tarnished.


**Target** *(Poisoned Search Results, Unexpected Expenses)*: Target was able to speedily deal with their data breach, alerting customers 20 days after (4 days after Target noticed). However, after the data breach, customers were worried that their data would be leaked, and so they were hesitant to buy from Target. Reportedly, earnings fell 46% for Target following the attack, with far fewer households shopping at Target after the breach.

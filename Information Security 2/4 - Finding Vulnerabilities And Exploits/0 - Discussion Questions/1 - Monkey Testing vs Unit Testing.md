## Compare the strategies of “Monkey Testing” with “Unit Testing.” What are the similarities and differences between them? What strengths does one have over the other?

Monkey testing and unit testing are both software testing strategies, but they have different purposes and strengths. Monkey testing is a method where random inputs are applied to a system to test its robustness and stability, while Unit testing is a method where individual units of code are tested in isolation to identify bugs early in development process. Monkey testing is a good method for testing the robustness and stability of a system, it can reveal unexpected bugs that other methods may not have identified. Unit testing, on the other hand, is a good method for identifying bugs early in the development process, and for ensuring that changes to the code don't break existing functionality. Both methods can be complementary to each other and improve the overall quality and robustness of the system.

## Provide an example of a recent news story that involves a zero-day vulnerability. How typical is it compared with the report given by the RAND corporation in the video “Zero Days, Thousands of Nights: The Life & Times of Zero-Day Engineering?”

One example of a recent news story that involves a zero-day vulnerability is the vulnerability in the Microsoft Exchange Server that was exploited by Chinese state-sponsored hackers earlier last year. The vulnerability, which was a zero-day, allowed the hackers to gain unauthorized access to email servers and steal sensitive information. Microsoft issued a patch for the vulnerability after it was discovered, but it is estimated that tens of thousands of organizations were affected before the patch was released.

This story is typical compared to the report given by the RAND Corporation in the video "Zero Days, Thousands of Nights: The Life & Times of Zero-Day Engineering". The report states that zero-day vulnerabilities are often discovered and exploited by state-sponsored actors, and that they are often used for cyber espionage and intelligence gathering.

Additionally, the RAND report also indicates that the discovery and exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities is not a rare event, but rather a constant process. The example of the Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerability confirms this, as it was one of multiple zero-day vulnerabilities that have been discovered and exploited in recent years.

## You have forgotten your password, so you click on “forgot my password” to have a new password sent by email. Sometimes the site tells you what your password was; other times, it sends you a new (usually temporary) password. What are the privacy implications of each approach?

When a website tells you your old password, it could be a security risk if that information falls into the wrong hands. On the other hand, when a website sends you a new password it can be a more secure option as it ensures the password is not intercepted during transmission. This method can protect against threats such as hackers or phishing scams. It is best practice for a website to generate new random password and send it securely, instead of giving the users their old password.

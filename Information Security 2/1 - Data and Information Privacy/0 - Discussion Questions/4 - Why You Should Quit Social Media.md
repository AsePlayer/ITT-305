## View TED Talk “Why You Should Quit Social Media,” located in the topic Resources. Provide your opinion on the main argument which indicates that he is happier, more sustainable, and more successful professionally without social media.

From the author’s experience of not using social media, they can report two things. The first is that it can be quite productive. He’s found that if you treat your attention with respect, that means you don't fragment it, that you let it stay whole, that you maintain your concentration, you can do one thing after another with intensity, and intensity can be traded for time, so when it comes to work, you can do it one thing after another with intensity. If you give each thing intense concentration after another, you can accomplish a lot in an eight-hour day. 

The other thing the author could say about life without social media is that it can actually be a restorative, peaceful way to actually spend your time out of work. Having no social media isn't so bad. You don't have the constant hum of stimuli, as well as the background hum of anxiety that comes with that.

# Topic 1 DQ 2
## Imagine a situation where a university implements a radio frequency identification (RFID) chip in every studentâ€™s personal ID card. Then, address the following.

## 1. Provide at least three examples of applications the university could create to utilize this ID tag information. For each of the three examples, explain the data the university would have to collect from the student to make the application work well.
## 2. Explain the potential for abuse that would exist from rogue RFID readers.
## 3. Consider the fact that GCU wants every student to voluntarily install the mobile phone application, "GCU Student". A link to this resource is located in the topic Resources. How is this application similar to the RFID solution? How is it different? What potential exists for abuse of data?

1. 
    a) Attendance tracking: The university could develop an application that uses the RFID chip in students' ID cards to automatically track attendance at lectures, seminars, and other academic events. In order for this application to function effectively, the university must collect information about each student's schedule, including the times and locations of their classes.

    b) Library check-out: To automate the process of checking out library books, the university could create an application utilizing the RFID chip contained in students' identification cards. In order for this application to function properly, the university must collect information about the library accounts of every student, such as the books checked out and their due dates.

    c) Dining services: Using the RFID chip in students' ID cards, the university could manage meal plans and track their purchases at on-campus dining locations. This application would only work if the university collected information about each student's meal plans and dining history, including what they have purchased and when.
2. 
    A rogue RFID reader can access the data stored on the chips in students' ID cards and abuse that information. A hacker could, for example, track a student's movements on campus and gather information about their schedules and locations if he or she were able to install a rogue RFID reader. The chip's financial information may also be accessible by rogue RFID readers, enabling unauthorized purchases or gaining access to other sensitive information.
3. 
    As with the RFID solution, the GCU Student app is a way for the university to manage and collect student information. As opposed to the RFID solution, which automatically collects data using RFID chips, it requires students to actively download and use the application. Data can potentially be misused in both the RFID solution and the GCU Student application if rogue readers or hackers are allowed to access and misuse the data collected. Nevertheless, the risks of data abuse may be more significant with the RFID solution, since it requires less active participation from students as well as being more susceptible to external threats.

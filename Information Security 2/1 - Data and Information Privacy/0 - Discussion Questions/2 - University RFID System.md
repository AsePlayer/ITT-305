## Imagine a situation where a university implements a radio frequency identification (RFID) chip in every studentâ€™s personal ID card. Then, address the following.

## 1. Provide at least three examples of applications the university could create to utilize this ID tag information. For each of the three examples, explain the data the university would have to collect from the student to make the application work well.
## 2. Explain the potential for abuse that would exist from rogue RFID readers.
## 3. Consider the fact that GCU wants every student to voluntarily install the mobile phone application, "GCU Student". A link to this resource is located in the topic Resources. How is this application similar to the RFID solution? How is it different? What potential exists for abuse of data?

# Who is Following Your Digital Footprints?

During this assignment, student will learn to quantify the amount of data being collected on sites they commonly use as well as utilize recommendations for limiting unnecessary data sharing.

**Part 1 - Your Digital Footprints**

In this section, students will examine tools that reveal how much information is shared when using a web browser.

1. View “Four Reasons to Care About Your Digital Footprint” and summarize the risks involved in leaving a digital footprint.
2. Navigate to the “Oracle Data Cloud” website and review what a personal profile looks like from the point of view of an online advertiser. Some users will have no data profile. Others will have extensive information about their age, interests, and purchasing habits. Describe the accuracy and scope of the data that your browser reveals about you.
3. Ghostery will tell you which third party applications are running on a website. After installing Ghostery, visit five websites you commonly use including: a news site, a discussion board or fan site about your hobbies, a free game site, a non-profit organization, and a social media company site. Complete the “ITT-306 Ghostery Table and Reflection Template.”
4. One of the services you may notice in the Ghostery list is OutBrain. View “What is Outbrain?” to see how the company works. Several case studies of successful clients of Outbrain are listed on their site. InnoGames is one customer who is highlighted as a success. Read the “InnoGames: How to Reach a Highly Profitable Audience and Ensure App Downloads Growth,” What makes OutBrain an attractive service for InnoGames?

On a scale of 0 (totally evil big brother) to 10 (helpful friend on the Internet), what is your impression of OutBrain and their clients? Justify your rationale.

**Part 2 - The Motives Behind the Ads**

Facebook and Apple both recently released ads about privacy. View “Facebook Here Together (UK)” and “Privacy on iPhone – Simple as That – Apple.” Then complete the following:

1. Identify key phrases or tag lines used by each company that succinctly tell the points of view of Apple and Facebook regarding privacy.
2. What similarities and differences do you see in these ads? Who is playing offense (promoting their brand) or defense (reacting to criticism)?
3. Consider sources of income for the largest technology companies by reading “What is the Business Model of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft?” How does knowing their sources of income affect your perception of each company’s privacy policy? What similarities and differences do you see between the revenue source for Apple and Facebook?
4. Play the contrarian and skeptic. Look for hypocrisy, misinformation, bias, or missing information in these ads from Apple and Facebook. Provide each company’s ad a rating from 1 (fake) to 5 (authentic) based on what you know about the company’s background and explain your answer.
5. How do either of these ads affect your opinion or influence your behavior in purchasing or using their products?

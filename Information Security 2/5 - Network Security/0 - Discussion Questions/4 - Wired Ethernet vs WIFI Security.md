## Compare the relative security of a wired ethernet computer to a WIFI connected computer. What tools are required to capture packets in each scenario?

Wired Ethernet networks are generally considered to be more secure than wireless networks because they require physical access to the network infrastructure. To capture packets on a wired Ethernet network you need a tool like Wireshark. On the other hand, wireless networks can be accessed by anyone within range and capturing packets on a wireless network requires specialized tools like Aircrack-ng, Cain & Abel, Kismet, and WiFi Pineapple. Capturing packets on wireless networks can be more complex than on wired networks but with the right tools, both types of networks can be monitored to prevent security breaches.

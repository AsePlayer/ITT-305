## How does the issue of vulnerability hunting and sales relate to the FBI versus Apple case?

This situation is similar to vulnerability hunting because, in both cases, there is a trade-off between security and privacy. In the case of vulnerability hunting, the question is whether to keep a vulnerability secret in order to prevent it from being exploited by malicious actors, or to disclose it in order to allow companies to patch the vulnerability and improve security. In the case of the FBI versus Apple, the question is whether to allow the FBI to bypass encryption in order to investigate a crime, or to maintain the encryption in order to protect the privacy and security of all customers.

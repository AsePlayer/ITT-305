## Edward Snowden was a huge news story in 2013. To what extent do his actions affect us today? Have we moved on to other matters or are his main arguments still relevant in todayâ€™s elections, policy debates, and government behavior?

Edward Snowden's actions in 2013, when he leaked classified information about the National Security Agency's (NSA) surveillance programs, sparked a global conversation about surveillance, privacy, and civil liberties, and continues to influence policy debates today. His disclosures revealed the extent of government surveillance and led to a shift in public opinion on privacy issues. It also led to the passing of laws like the USA Freedom Act in the United States, which limited certain domestic surveillance activities. The issues Snowden brought to light have continued to be relevant in today's policy debates and government behavior. In most recent years, it has been a central topic in most of the election campaigns, privacy-related debates, and discussions around balancing security with civil liberties. The disclosures made by Snowden also prompted a global conversation about surveillance, privacy, and democracy that is still ongoing.

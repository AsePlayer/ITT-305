## Compare the FBI versus Apple conflict from San Bernadino to the shooting incident in Pensacola, FL. What has changed in regard to technology? What has changed in regard to opinions on each side? What has remained the same?

In the San Bernardino case, the FBI wanted Apple to create a "backdoor" to bypass the encryption on the locked iPhone of the shooter. Apple refused, arguing that creating such a backdoor would set a dangerous precedent and could undermine the security and privacy of all of its customers. The FBI ultimately found another way to access the data on the phone and the case was dropped.

In the Pensacola case, the FBI again sought Apple's assistance in unlocking two iPhones belonging to the shooter. In this case, however, Apple provided the FBI with data from the phones that had been backed up to iCloud, and also offered to assist in the ongoing investigation.

One thing that changed in terms of technology is that, in the time between the two cases, the security of iPhone has been increased with the new IOS updates, the most recent IOS 14 has even more secure encryption. Additionally, Apple has also started offering security features such as two-factor authentication, which makes it more difficult for hackers to gain access to an iCloud account.

In terms of opinions on each side, it seems that the FBI has shifted its position to take a more accommodating approach to technology companies. The FBI has recognized that the encryption issue is more complex than it originally thought, and that it needs the help of tech companies to solve crimes and prevent acts of terrorism. On the other hand, it seems that technology companies have remained consistent in their position of protecting their users' privacy and security, but have become more willing to work with law enforcement agencies under certain circumstances.

What remained the same, is the FBI's legal authority to have access to the data in cases related to national security or criminal investigations. Also, the technology companies' responsibility to protect their user's data and privacy as well as to comply with the legal requests.

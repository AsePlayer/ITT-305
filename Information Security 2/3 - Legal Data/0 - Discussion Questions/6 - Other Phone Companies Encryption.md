## Research the issue of why Apple received public heat from the FBI.  Are other phones using strong encryption?  What is Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and other major phone and app makers doing with encryption backdoors?

Apple received public heat from the FBI because of its stance on encryption and its refusal to create a "backdoor" for the FBI to bypass the encryption on the locked iPhone used by one of the shooters in the San Bernardino case in 2015.

It's worth noting that other phone manufacturers have also implemented strong encryption in their products. For example, Google also uses encryption on its Android devices, and Microsoft has implemented encryption in its Windows operating system. Other tech giants like Facebook and WhatsApp also use encryption to protect users' data and communication.

When it comes to encryption backdoors, most major phone and app makers have also taken a similar stance as Apple, they generally oppose the creation of encryption backdoors because they argue that these backdoors would make their products less secure and would put the privacy of their users at risk. Some companies have even pledged to not build "backdoors" in their products and to not provide governments with encryption keys.

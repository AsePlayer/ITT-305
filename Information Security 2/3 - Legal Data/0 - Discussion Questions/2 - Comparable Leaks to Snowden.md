## What other examples from U.S. history can be compared with the Edward Snowden security leak? How does their outcome help in predicting where Snowdenâ€™s case may end up?

There are several examples from U.S. history that can be compared to the Edward Snowden security leak. Some notable examples include:

The Pentagon Papers: In 1971, a group of government officials leaked classified information about U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War to the New York Times. The information revealed that the government had misled the public about the progress and scope of the war. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of the New York Times' right to publish the information.

Chelsea Manning: In 2010, Army Private Chelsea Manning leaked classified information to WikiLeaks, including a video of a U.S. helicopter attack that killed two Reuters journalists. Manning was arrested and convicted under the Espionage Act.

Daniel Ellsberg: In 1971, former military analyst Daniel Ellsberg leaked the Pentagon Papers, which revealed the U.S. government's lies about the Vietnam War. Like Snowden, Ellsberg was charged under the Espionage Act and his case was seen as a test of the government's ability to keep secrets and the public's right to know.

Each of these cases has similarities to Edward Snowden's leak in terms of the type of information leaked, the implications for government secrecy, and the legal and political repercussions. However, it's important to note that each case is unique, and the outcome of previous leaks can't be used to predict how Snowden's case will end up. It also highlights that the outcome can be highly dependent on the political climate and the balance of power in the government.

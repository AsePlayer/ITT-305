## Find a recent example of a cyberattack in the news. Summarize what happened and the response of the victim. Do you think the response was appropriate? Sufficient? Could the issue have been prevented? Justify your reasoning.

An example of a recent cyber attack is the ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline in May 2021. The pipeline is the largest refined product pipeline in the United States and it transport gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other refined petroleum products.

"DarkSide" (was responsible for the attack, which is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group that allows other hackers to use its ransomware at a fee. In effect, the group rendered the pipeline inoperable by encrypting its computer systems. Consequently, Colonial Pipeline's pipeline system was temporarily shut down, causing major fuel shortages throughout the eastern United States.

In response to the attack, the company paid the attackers an undisclosed amount of bitcoin to regain access to their systems. Colonial Pipeline also engaged with cyber security experts to address the issue and restore its systems. Additionally, the FBI and other agencies have been investigating the attack and have been able to trace the bitcoin payment to a specific address and arrested some of the individuals involved.

There is a possibility that the response was appropriate as the company had to quickly restore its systems to prevent further damage. Paying the ransom is a common practice among victims of ransomware attack as it guarantees to regain access to their systems. But some experts argue that paying the ransom only encourages the attackers to continue their activity, and hence it should be avoided if possible.

It could be said that the issue could have been prevented, as  the company was using outdated software which contributed to the vulnerability of its systems. Implementing regular software updates and backups would have likely prevented the attack from being as severe as it was, too.

## Do you feel the typical American citizen has enough of an understanding of cybersecurity? If yes, explain why the “typical” knowledge is sufficient. If not, explain what information they should know and propose how you would disseminate that information.

In my opinion, (outside of this degree) the typical American citizen does not have enough knowledge about cybersecurity, which is a growing concern given the increasing dependence on the Internet and digital technology in all aspects of life.

Here are some key areas that American citizens should be aware of in regards to cybersecurity:
* Understanding common types of cyber threats, such as phishing scams, malware, and ransomware.
* Recognizing the importance of creating and maintaining strong passwords, and being aware of best practices for password security.
* Being aware of the importance of keeping software and devices updated, in order to address any vulnerabilities.
* Understanding the importance of keeping personal information private, and being mindful of the amount of personal information shared online.
* Being familiar with basic security measures, such as firewalls and antivirus software.

To disseminate this information, there are several strategies that can be used:
* Developing a video game with cybersecurity as its core theme
* Developing online resources such as guides, tutorials, and interactive learning tools that provide information about cybersecurity in an engaging and easy-to-understand format.
* Providing cybersecurity training and education in schools, from primary to high school level, is a strong step towards preparing a generation that is better educated about the dangers and risks of the internet.
* Parents should have the cybersecurity “talk” with their kids.

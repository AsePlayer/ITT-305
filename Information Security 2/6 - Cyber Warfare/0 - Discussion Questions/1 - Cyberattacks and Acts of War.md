# Topic 6 DQ 1
## Interpret the readings from this topic to answer the following questions. When should a cyberattack be considered an act of warfare? Where is the line? What are acceptable forms of defense and offense? Justify your answers.

Various countries and organizations have different views on what constitutes a cyberattack.

One perspective is that a cyberattack should be considered an act of warfare when it causes significant physical damage or loss of life. Another perspective is that a cyberattack should be considered an act of warfare when it causes significant disruption to the normal functioning of a country or organization. 

The line between what constitutes an act of cyber warfare and cybercrime can be difficult to draw, and it might differ according to different laws, international agreements, and perspectives. As such, it can be challenging to come up with a universally accepted definition. In my opinion, everyone crosses the line constantly.

Cyber defense should focus on protecting national and individual cyber assets, while cyber offense should focus on disrupting and disabling the cyber capabilities of adversaries. In terms of offensive cyber operations, the use of military force through cyber means should comply with the same principles of distinction, proportionality and necessity as those that apply to the use of force in general.

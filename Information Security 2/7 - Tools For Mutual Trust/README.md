# Topic 7: Tools For Mutual Trust
Two of the most basic activities on the internet are communication and business transactions. Communication and transactions need to be trusted in order to be effectively utilized. This assignment will explore how email has adjusted to the spam threat and how blockchain promises to be the standard method for conducting trusted transactions. Improvements in spam detection have kept email as the default, vender neutral means of communication even though there are other forms of text communication that are more secure. Unlike traditional databases, which are administered by a central authority, blockchain technology relies on a peer-to-peer network. Authentication of transactions is achieved through hashing algorithms which allows participants with no particular trust in each other to trust the system.

Objectives:
1. Identify steps used in email server communications.
2. Identify systems used to filter spam messages.
3. Explain the use of hashing in a blockchain and how it authenticates the validity of transactions.
4. Demonstrate a series of transactions using a hashing algorithm to verify the authenticity of all transactions made in a blockchain.

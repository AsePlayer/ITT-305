## Explain the processes used in identifying spam email. Specifically, how does a spam filter develop a formula for rating the trustworthiness of an email message.

A spam filter uses a variety of methods to identify spam email and rate the trustworthiness of an email message:

* Rules-based filtering: This method uses a set of pre-defined rules, such as keywords and phrases, to identify spam email. For example, if an email contains certain words or phrases that are commonly associated with spam, such as "Nigerian prince," the spam filter will flag it as spam.

* Heuristic filtering: This method uses a set of heuristics, or educated guesses, to identify spam email. For example, the filter may look at the structure of the email, the domain of the sender's email address, or the presence of certain characters or symbols.

* Bayesian Filtering: This method is based on the Bayes' theorem and uses statistical analysis to evaluate the probability that an email is spam. The filter is trained on a set of example emails, some of which are marked as spam and some of which are not. Once the filter is trained, it can use the statistical analysis to evaluate new emails, based on the words and phrases that are commonly found in spam emails.

* Machine Learning based methods: More recently, advanced machine learning algorithms are used to analyze email data and identify patterns that are indicative of spam email. This includes supervised methods like random forest, decision tree, k-NN etc and unsupervised methods like clustering, anomaly detection etc.

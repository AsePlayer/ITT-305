## Explain how hashing is used in the context of blockchain.

Hashing is used in the blockchain to create a unique digital signature (hash) for each block of transactions. The hash function takes the input of the block's data, and returns a fixed-size output known as the hash. This hash is unique to that specific block and any change in data of the block will change the resulting hash. Hashing is used to ensure the integrity and security of data by allowing to verify if a block has been tampered with. Additionally, it creates a chain of blocks by linking each block's hash to the previous one, creating an unbreakable and tamper-proof record of all the transactions on the blockchain network.

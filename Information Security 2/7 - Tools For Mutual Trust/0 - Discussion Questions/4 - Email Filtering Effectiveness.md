## Email filtering effectiveness improved greatly with the methods shown in this lesson. Spam phone calls, or robo calls, remain a problem today. What methods could be applied to routing phone calls and why have they not been widely applied?

There are a number of methods that can be applied to filtering unwanted phone calls, such as robocalls. One common approach is to use caller ID authentication, which verifies that the caller's phone number matches the caller ID that is displayed on the recipient's phone. Another method is using the STIR/SHAKEN protocol, it's a set of procedures that aims to authenticate phone calls and protect against caller ID spoofing, a tactic used by robocallers to hide their true identities.

However, these methods have not been widely adopted for several reasons. One reason holding back caller ID authentication is that robocallers often use spoofed caller IDs. Additionally, STIR/SHAKEN is a relatively new development, and not all phone companies have adopted it yet.

## What purposes, other than Bit Coin and related currency, has blockchain been used for? Discuss the improvements that blockchain provides over the previous method of doing business.

Blockchain technology has been used for a variety of purposes beyond just Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Some examples of other uses for blockchain include:

1. Supply Chain Management: Blockchain can be used to create an immutable record of all the transactions that occur within a supply chain, allowing for greater transparency and traceability. This can help to reduce fraud and increase efficiency.

2. Smart Contracts: Blockchain can be used to facilitate the execution of self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement being directly written into lines of code. These Smart Contracts reduce human involvement and lead to lower costs and less errors.

3. Health care: Blockchain could be used to securely store patient's health records, allowing for faster and more accurate diagnoses, and giving patients more control over their own health information.

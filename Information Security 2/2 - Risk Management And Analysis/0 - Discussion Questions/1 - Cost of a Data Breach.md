## Refer to the IBM report “Cost of a Data Breach Report 2019” in the topic Resources to answer the following.

## What factors contribute most to a company’s expenses when a data breach occurs? What can we conclude is a company’s most valuable asset?

According to the IBM report "Cost of a Data Breach Report 2019," the primary factors that contribute to a company's expenses when a data breach occurs include the cost of incident response and investigations, notification and credit monitoring for affected individuals, and post-breach customer turnover. Additionally, companies may also incur expenses related to legal fees, regulatory fines, and other post-breach measures to restore the company's reputation.

In terms of a company's most valuable asset, the report concludes that a company's ability to maintain the trust and confidence of its customers is its most valuable asset. This is because a data breach can have a significant negative impact on a company's reputation, leading to a loss of customers and revenue. Additionally, the report also highlights that when a company has a data breach, the proportion of customers who will lose trust in the company is far greater than the proportion of customers whose data was actually compromised.

Therefore, it's clear that maintaining the security of sensitive data and protecting it from breaches is critical not only from a regulatory and compliance perspective, but also from a business perspective. A company's reputation, and therefore, its most valuable asset, is at risk when a data breach occurs.

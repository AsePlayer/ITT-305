## After reading Chapter 10 in “Security in Computing,” list three factors that should be considered when developing a security plan. Explain why each factor deserves consideration.

1. Identifying and assessing risks: A security plan should take into account the potential risks that an organization may face, such as natural disasters, cyber attacks, or insider threats. By identifying and assessing these risks, the organization can better understand the potential impact of a security incident and develop appropriate measures to mitigate or respond to them. This step is important because without understanding and identifying risks, it would be hard to develop a plan that addresses them in an efficient way.

2. Planning for incident response and recovery: A security plan should include procedures for responding to and recovering from security incidents. This may include procedures for incident management, incident response teams, and incident recovery teams. This is important because having a well-defined incident response and recovery plan in place will help the organization quickly and effectively respond to and recover from security incidents, minimizing the impact on the organization.

3. Regularly reviewing and updating the plan: A security plan should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that it remains effective in addressing the risks and threats that the organization faces. This can involve evaluating the effectiveness of existing controls, monitoring for new threats and vulnerabilities, and incorporating new security technologies and best practices. This step is important because the security threats are constantly evolving, the plan should be updated to meet the new challenges, if not then the plan becomes irrelevant.

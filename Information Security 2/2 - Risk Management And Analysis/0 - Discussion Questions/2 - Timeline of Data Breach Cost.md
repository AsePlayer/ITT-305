## Describe the timeline of when costs to a company are incurred. That is, do most expenses occur immediately following the discovery of a breach or are they long-term impacts to the company?

According to the IBM report "Cost of a Data Breach Report 2019," the timeline of costs to a company that is incurred following a data breach can vary. The report states that the immediate costs are typically incurred during the initial incident response and investigation phase, which includes activities such as identifying and containing the breach, as well as assessing the scope and impact of the incident. These costs can include expenses related to hiring outside experts and consultants, as well as incident response teams.

In addition to the initial incident response costs, companies also incur expenses related to notification and credit monitoring for affected individuals. These costs are typically incurred shortly after the discovery of a breach, and can include expenses related to mailings, call center support, and credit monitoring services.

In addition to these immediate costs, companies also incur long-term expenses related to post-breach customer turnover, legal fees, and regulatory fines. The cost of customer turnover, which can include expenses related to acquiring new customers to replace those who have left, can continue for several years following a breach. Additionally, regulatory fines and legal fees, which can be significant, can also be incurred months or even years after the initial incident.
